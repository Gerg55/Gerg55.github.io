    <img src="Images/Cengine.png" height="411" width="691" title="A mountain 3D model, showcasing shadow mapping and model loading (very early stages of the engine)"/>
    <h2>Current features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.gply format model loading (includes skeletons and animations)</li>
        <li>Standard shader using a Blinn-Phong lighting model</li>
        <li>Simple material system</li>
        <li>Debug graphics</li>
        <li>Font atlas text rendering (won't be touching .ttf for a while)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recent additions / changes (15/06/25):</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Changed from .ply format to my custom .gply format for 3D models and animations</li>
       <li>Finished basic skeletal animation code, to be polished and re-added when I have an ECS</li>
       <li>Shader implementation refactor + geometry shader support</li>
       <li>Experiments not related to engine development (see below)</li>
       <li>decided to bring back this bloodeh github pages thing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Work in progress (15/06/25):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ECS (they're confusing)</li>

    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>
        This is not a proper game engine yet; it is currently more a framework for 3D graphics because that is what I have spent most time on. I am currently trying to understand sparse-sets, archetypes and other ECS optimistations. Once I have added an ECS interface I am happy with, 
        I can work on integrating a few things I've worked on at the side and adding more game centred features so I can finally make a prototype game. After that I will probably start making the engine an 
        actual engine with an editor, asset management, etc.
    <br> </br>    
        The engine development was a little stagnant because I was having more fun experimenting in the engine. These are what I made:<br>
        - Recreated the "Final Demo" of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJ-hdISgnw"target="_blank">Sebastian Lague's software rasterizer</a> of a plane flying through procedural terrain<br>
        - 3rd person character controller that I designed in Unity which I then added skeletal animation to (nicked the model from Sebatstain Lague)<br>
        - State machine wandering NPC (reminds me of my self ghagahaahaharaahaha) also with skeletal animation<br>
        - Realised I was stupid enough to copy code from my UBO tests into a function in my shader implementation without changing any literals to function parameters and not notice for nearly 2 months<br>
    <br> </br>    
        Below is a video of the game engine as of 17/03/25. It demonstrates the (at the time) recent addition of proper transformations (translation, scaling and rotation) and the material system which includes texturing and specular mapping. The specular mapping is not apparent in 
        the video because I had forgot to also transform the fragment position in the vertex shader making the specular highlights static on the objects. That has been fixed.
